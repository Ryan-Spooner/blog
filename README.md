# Ryan Spooner's Blog

*A voice. A reputation. An encouragement to learn through teaching.*
*Clear thinking. Exploring passions.*

Such are the motivations for this project. Writing, technology, faith,
and philosophy are mainstays in my life. To grow, I must challenge myself.

Structure and cadence matched with motivation and action will bear fruit.
It is not enough to dream or talk. Doing (and doing well), failing,
and adusting, are the means to actualize. My blog is an excercise in application.

Whatever's destined for my future, small decisions in the meantime will
affect it shape. What duty and wisdom contribute past sheer determination cannot
be understated, but either in isolation is inert.

To conclude, I will say, if you are reading this message, thanks for taking the
time. I hope you find value in my contibutions.

Regards,
Ryan
